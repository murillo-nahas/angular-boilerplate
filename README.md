## Angular Boilerplate

Simple boilerplate made with **Angular**, according my last post on my personal blog.
This boilerplate was made to make it more easy to start with an Angular project.

### Configuration

This boilerplate was made with an initial setup, with a home page and router configs. Anything else. 

### How to run?

Join in this project, run the `npm install` or `yarn install`, after that, run the project with `ng serve`.
